    "Ans : Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variable. "

It usually maintains a single shared value for all instances of class even if no instance object of the class exists.It is generally created when the program begins to execute.  It normally retains values until the program terminates.It has only one copy of the class variable so it is shared among different objects of the class.  It can be accessed by calling with the class name.  \n",

Instead, they only belong to one specific class.It usually reserves memory for data that the class needs.  It is generally created when an instance of the class is created.  It normally retains values as long as the object exists.  It has many copies so every object has its own personal copy of the instance variable. It can be accessed directly by calling variable names inside the class.  "
