    "Ans : the third of these matched patterns is “left-most longest, ” also known as greedy. In some cases, however, it may be desirable to obtain a “left-most shortest” or minimal match. We can make a greedy matching into a non-greedy match using ‘?‘ at the end of RE i.e ‘*?‘ matches the smallest number of instances of the preceding subexpression that will allow the overall match to succeed. Similarly, ‘+?‘ matches at least one instance, but no more than necessary to allow the overall match to succeed, and ‘??‘ matches either zero or one instances, with a preference for zero"
