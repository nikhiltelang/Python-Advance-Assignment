    "Ans : While both binary and text files contain data stored as a series of bits (binary values of 1s and 0s), the bits in text files represent characters, while the bits in binary files represent custom data. Binary files typically contain a sequence of bytes, or ordered groupings of eight bits."

    "Ans : Since text files include a minimal amount of formatting information, they tend to be small, easy to exchange between different platforms (i.e., from Windows to Linux or Mac or vice versa), and easy to send from one computer program to another. They can usually also be read by people using a text editor like Komodo Edit.Binary file can have custom file formats and the developer, who designs these custom file formats, converts the information, to be stored, in bits and arranges these bits in binary file so that they are well understood by the supporting application and when needed, can easily be read by the supporting application."
